## What This Is (and Isn't)

The word "Learning" in Learning React is purposeful. This is not an exhaustive list of everything in React and how to use it.

This book tries to outline and review major functionality React. Its purpose is to help someone *learning* React in order to move into more advanced functionality at their own pace. This can be thought of as a *crash course* in React functionality and concepts.
