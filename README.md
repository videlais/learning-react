## What This Is (and Isn't)

The word "Learning" in the title *Learning React* is purposeful. This is not an exhaustive list of everything in React and how to use it.

This book tries to outline and review major functionality React. Its purpose is to help someone *learning* React in order to move into more advanced functionality at their own pace. This can be thought of as more of a *crash course* in React functionality and concepts.
